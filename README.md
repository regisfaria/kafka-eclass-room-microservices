# [Kafka POC] E-ClassRoom

## Overview

This project is a POC done by me to get to know **Kafka** using **microservices/async architecture**.

The project is an online classroom, where users will be able to buy courses and enroll in them.

The backend microservices uses **NestJS** and the web frontend uses **Next.js**.

Authentications will be handled with **Auth0**.

In the backend microservices, I'll be using **Prisma** and **Postgres**.

The backend apps also features **GraphQL** and **Apollo Server**.
